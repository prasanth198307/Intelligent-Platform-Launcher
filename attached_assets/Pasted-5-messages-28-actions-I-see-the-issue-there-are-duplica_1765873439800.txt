Checked groq-sdk installation status
You're right - let me check if groq-sdk is properly installed and fix the issue:

Opened ipl-platform/apps/ai-generator-service/package.json

Decided on dependency addition
Missing groq-sdk - let me add it and explain what's still needed:

Installed groq-sdk

Analyzed Claude's missing features
Now let me explain what's still missing for it to work like me (Claude):

What's Currently Implemented:

Basic tool calling (6 tools for reading project state)
Multi-step reasoning loop (up to 5 iterations)
Automatic execution after building
What's Still Missing:

Code Verification Tools - I can actually run code and check for errors. Your agent needs:
run_typescript_check - Verify generated code compiles
run_linter - Check for code quality issues
test_api_endpoint - Hit the running app to verify it works
Write/Edit Tools - Currently the agent can only READ. It needs:
write_file - Create new files
edit_file - Modify existing files
execute_sql - Run database queries to fix data
Self-Correction - I verify my work before responding. The agent should:
Generate code → Check for errors → Fix issues → Verify again
Not just return the first attempt
Conversation Memory - I remember what was discussed. The agent needs:
Access to full conversation history when reasoning
Understanding of what was tried before
Error Recovery - When something fails, I debug it. The agent needs:
Read error logs
Analyze what went wrong
Try a different approach
Would you like me to add these capabilities? I'd start with:

Code verification tools (TypeScript check, API testing)
Write/edit tools so the agent can fix its own mistakes
Error log reading for self-debugging

Restarted workflow validation
Now let me update the task list and restart the workflow:

Ran final architect review

Restarted AI Generator Service

Called architect for review

Validated agentic AI system enhancement

Decided on architectural review outcome

Decided on header component styling
I've enhanced the AI agent to work more like me (Claude). Here's what's now implemented:

12 Tools in 3 Categories:

Reading Tools (understand the project):

get_project_info - See modules, tables, status
list_database_tables - See actual DB tables with columns
get_table_data - Sample data from tables
list_project_files - Browse generated code
read_file - Read specific files
get_domain_knowledge - Domain schemas (AMI, Healthcare, etc.)
Verification Tools (check the work):

run_typescript_check - Verify code compiles
test_api_endpoint - Call APIs to verify they work
read_app_logs - Check for runtime errors
check_file_syntax - Validate specific files
get_app_status - Check if app is running
Write Tools (fix issues):

write_file - Create or update files
execute_sql - Run database queries
Self-Correction Workflow:
The agent now follows a verification loop:

Build the module
Check for TypeScript errors
If errors → fix them with write_file
Test the API endpoint
Read logs if something fails
Only report success when everything works
Increased Reasoning:

Up to 8 iterations (from 5) for complex tasks
Uses tools to understand existing code before building
Creates proper foreign key relationships to existing tables
The AI agent can now investigate, build, verify, and fix - similar to how I work. Try asking it to build a module and watch it check the existing project before building!

Decided on workflow replication strategy
You're asking what it takes for your IPL AI agent to work like me - with the task management, reviews, and orchestration you see me doing. Here's the key difference:

What I Have (Claude/Replit Agent):

Persistent Loop with User - I run continuously, waiting for your input, then executing multiple steps before responding
Full File System Access - I can read/write any file, run shell commands, restart services
Orchestration Layer - A system that manages my tools, tracks tasks, and lets me call "sub-agents" (like the architect)
Large Context Window - I see the entire conversation history plus can read huge files
Self-Review - I have an "architect" agent I can call to review my work before finishing
What Your IPL Agent Has Now:

Single Request/Response - User sends message → AI responds once
Limited Tools - 12 tools for reading/writing project files
No Orchestration - No task tracking visible to user
No Self-Review - No separate review step
What You'd Need to Add:

Task Streaming - Show the user what the agent is doing in real-time (like my task list)
Multi-Agent Architecture - A "planner" agent + "executor" agent + "reviewer" agent
Persistent Memory - Store conversation history and project context between sessions
Human-in-the-Loop - Let user approve/reject before major actions
Progress UI - Display tool calls, results, and status updates live
Would you like me to start implementing any of these capabilities? The easiest to add first would be task streaming - showing the user what tools the agent is calling in real-time.

Planned architectural overhaul for agent capabilities
This is a major upgrade - turning your AI agent into a full Claude-like system. Let me plan this out:
