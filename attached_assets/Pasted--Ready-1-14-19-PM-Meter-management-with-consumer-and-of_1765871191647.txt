Meter management  with consumer and office, network like substation feeder and transformer, network hierarchy from Subsation to meter/ consumer
1:14:20 PM
I'd be happy to help with meter management! It sounds like you're looking to manage meters, consumers, and office data, as well as network infrastructure like substations, feeders, and transformers. Could you tell me more about what specific aspects of meter management you'd like to focus on?

**Suggested modules:**
• Meter Data Management (MDM)
• Device Management
• Network Management

**Questions to consider:**
• Do you need to track meter readings, billing, or other specific data?
• How do you envision the network hierarchy being represented in the system?
• Are there any specific features or integrations you need for the office or consumer side of things?

I'd be happy to help with the Meter Data Management module! To confirm, you'd like to build a module that handles VEE processing and billing preparation, including tables for billing determinants and tariffs, as well as APIs for validating readings and calculating bills. Is that correct?

**Suggested modules:**
• Meter Data Management (MDM)

**Questions to consider:**
• Do you need to integrate with any existing systems, such as a Head End System or a billing system?
• Are there any specific VEE processing rules or billing calculations you'd like to prioritize?
